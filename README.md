FRC 2022 Season Java Robot Code

Rapid React game launch happens on 2022, Saturday 8th, 12:30pm.

Java code uses command based programming which breaks up the code into classes that represent subsystems and commands that execute methods in the subsystems.
## Subsystems

Every robot contains multiple subsystems. 
### Drivetrain
The first subsystem that always exists is the drivetrain. The drivetrain represents the structure and motors that moves the robot around the field.
